        <h1>A Brief History</h1>
        <p>Studio 400 is a Cal Poly Architecture thesis studio occupying room 400 of the architecture building. For well over a decade, Studio 400 has been leading the way in radical thought and design amongst the 9 thesis studios with an approach based in rigorous research and writing, culminating in unique architectural projects tackling a wide variety of topics and issues. Formerly led by long-time professor Karen Lange, the 2021-22 school year is a moment of evolution for the studio under the new leadership of Emily White. As a Sci-Arc graduate and former professor she brings a similarly radical approach to architecture with extensive knowledge of current thought in academia. As a mother to two young children, she also brings a lighthearted tone to keep her students engaged and in constant dialogue with each other.</p>
        <p>The students of the 2021-22 school year are engaged in a wide variety of topics, from politics to disciplinary critiques to envisioning new rituals around death. All of these topics, through rigorous research and design, spawn inventive projects that are unique to the design sensibilities of each student. Inside this pamphlet is a small sample of some work in progress, as the students are working to develop visual arguments with a strong connection to their written thesis statements.</p>

        <h1>Development of an Architectural Thesis</h1>
        <h3>Fall Quarter</h3>
        <p>In the Fall, students may or may not come with some idea of a direction for their thesis projects. A primary task of the thesis professor is to guide the student in a direction that situates an architectural interest in a broader context. The companion seminar class helps to instigate student research by covering a wide variety of critically relevant topics, with readings serving as starting points for independent research. The quarter culminates in a written thesis statement of at least 2500 words, with several visual artifacts showing early thinking.</p>
        <h3>Winter Quarter</h3>
        <p>In the Winter, students will choose a site and begin to develop the written argument into one that is visual and architectural. The visual and written argument continually develop and play off of each other as development continues, and an architectural project begins to take form. The quarter culminates in Qualifying Review, marking the point of no return, where each student is critiqued by a panel of all the thesis professors. A thesis book is at roughly 75% completion, and studios have begun to plan their Spring Quarter exhibitions.</p>
        <h3>Spring Quarter</h3>
        <p>In the Spring, studios typically begin with a week of travel, sometimes international, to experience architecture of different places as a collective. Once class resumes, it is full steam ahead, as students scramble to finish their final design while juggling creating a model, finishing their book, and putting in the necessary work to develop the studio show, which usually falls in the middle of the quarter and exhibits models (and sometimes other work) of the studio in a collective fashion. The quarter culminates in a massive show of the completed work of all 150+ thesis students, formal presentations of all the work, and a completed thesis book showing showing the argument, design, and its development.</p>
